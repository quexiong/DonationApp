# Sunshine Bank
For Hmong-Americans (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hmong_Americans), an essential element of our culture is giving money donations to family/friends/community in times of celebration and death. While the ACT of giving the donation is nothing more than making a simple donation, the GIFT itself has a special name in our culture, which is "nyiaj tshav ntuj" or literally translated as "sunshine money" in English. Traditionally, when money is donated during an event, it is recorded by the person/family receiving it, but they don't issue receipts to the donor. For that reason, I decided to create a simple web app named Sunshine Bank that will help Hmong people record and maintain their sunshine money donations.  

## How it works
- The app launches with this landing page that briefly summarizes the purpose of the app.
